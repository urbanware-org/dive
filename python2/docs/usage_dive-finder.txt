    1. Definition

        The Dive Content Finder script searches the content files for a given
        search term.

        It also allows using a search pattern with wildcards as well as
        regular expressions.

    2. General stuff

        2.1 How to run Python scripts

            All usage examples below show how to execute the Python scripts on
            the shell of a Unix-like system. If you do not know, how to run
            those scripts on your operating system, you may have a look at
            this page:

                http://www.urbanware.org/howto_python.html

        2.2 Overview of all command-line arguments

            Usually, each script requires command-line arguments to operate.
            So, to get an overview of all arguments available, simply run the
            script with the "--help" argument. For example:

                $ ./dive-finder.py --help

    3. Find contents

        In the following examples the existing content files are stored inside
        the directory "/home/johndoe/dive/content".

        3.1 Find contents using basic strings

            If you want to search your content files for the search term
            "foobar" the command line would look like this:

                $ ./dive-finder.py -d /home/johndoe/dive/content -s "foobar"

            The given search term is being processed case-insensitive by
            default. That means, the search term given above would match
            "foobar" as well as e. g. "Foobar", "FooBar", "FOOBAR", "FOObar"
            and so on.

            So, to process the search term case-sensitive, type:

                $ ./dive-finder.py -d /home/johndoe/dive/content -s "foobar" \
                                   -c

            Before version 1.2.8, the arguments for the search term ("-s") and
            the case sensitivity ("-c") were the other way around. So, in the
            earlier versions "-c" was standing for "criteria" and "-s" for the
            case sensitivity. Due to the fact, that "criteria" was renamed to
            "search term" (for more clarity) in version 1.2.8, those argument
            shortcuts have been swapped.

        3.2 Find contents using wildcards

            The search term also supports asterisk wildcards. For example,
            if you want to search for a string that starts with "foo" and ends
            with "bar", type:

                $ ./dive-finder.py -d /home/johndoe/dive/content -s "foo*bar"

            You can also use multiple asterisk wildcards within the search
            term

                $ ./dive-finder.py -d /home/johndoe/dive/content -s "foo*b*r"

            as well as multiple search terms (seperated by semicolons)

                $ ./dive-finder.py -d /home/johndoe/dive/content -s "foo;bar"

            and also multiple search terms with wildcards:

                $ ./dive-finder.py -d /home/johndoe/dive/content -s "f*o;b*r"

        3.3 Read error tag

            In case read errors will be ignored and a read error occurs when
            trying to read an archive, the archive file will be added to the
            content file with the additional "[?]" tag, so you can see inside
            the content file that there was a problem reading the archive.
