## Definition

The *Dive* project is a media content finder which allows to search for data on various storage devices without requiring the devices containing the data itself.

[Top](#dive-)

## Details

As already mentioned, *Dive* basically is a media content finder which allows to search data on storage media that is currently not inserted or connected.

The project consists of two components, a content file builder and a content finder. These are portable, which means that you can copy the created content files e. g. onto a memory stick along with the *Dive* project files to use it from various systems. Details about the components can be found inside the [wiki](../../wiki#components).

On April 2018 the project has officially been discontinued. Details can be found [here](https://github.com/urbanware-org/dive/wiki#end-of-life).
